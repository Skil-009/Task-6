The common attacks on passwords can be broadly categorized into two main types: guessing/cracking attempts and social engineering/interception methods.

Here is a research summary of the most frequent and effective password attacks:

Research Summary: Common Attacks on Passwords
1. Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks
These are the most fundamental password-cracking techniques, which often use automated tools to try to guess credentials.

Attack Type	Methodology	Key Vulnerability Exploited
Brute Force	A systematic, automated trial-and-error process that tries every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found.	Password Length (Shorter passwords are cracked faster).
Dictionary	An automated attack that attempts passwords from a pre-compiled list (or "dictionary") of the most common passwords, common words, common phrases, and variations (like substituting 'o' with '0' or 'i' with '1').	Password Simplicity (Weak, common, or dictionary-based passwords).
Password Spraying	A targeted variation where an attacker tries a small number of common passwords (e.g., Password123) against a large list of usernames. This avoids triggering account lockouts that typically occur when a single account receives too many failed attempts.	Weak/Default Passwords (Especially in corporate environments).

2. Credential Stuffing
This is one of the most effective modern attacks, as it exploits human behavior rather than system weaknesses.

Attack Type	Methodology	Key Vulnerability Exploited
Credential Stuffing	Attackers take a large list of stolen username and password pairs (obtained from a data breach on one website) and automatically "stuff" them as login attempts into other, unrelated websites (e.g., banking, social media).	Password Reuse (Users using the same password across multiple sites).

3. Social Engineering and Interception
These methods rely on tricking a user or passively intercepting data to obtain the password directly.

Attack Type	Methodology	Key Vulnerability Exploited
Phishing	The attacker sends a deceptive communication (like an email or text) that masquerades as a trusted entity (e.g., a bank, a colleague). The goal is to trick the user into voluntarily clicking a link to a fake login page and entering their credentials.	Human Error/Trust (Lack of user awareness and vigilance).
Keylogging	Attackers install a malicious software (keylogger) or a physical device on a victim's computer to secretly record and transmit every keystroke they type, including usernames and passwords.	Malware/System Vulnerability (Unpatched systems or devices without proper antivirus protection).
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)	An attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly. In a password attack, this often occurs on unsecured public Wi-Fi to capture login credentials as they are transmitted.	Unsecured Network Traffic (Lack of HTTPS/SSL encryption).

4. Offline Attacks
These attacks occur after a system has already been breached and the password data (the password hashes) has been stolen.

Attack Type	Methodology	Key Vulnerability Exploited
Rainbow Table Attack	Attackers use pre-computed tables of hash values to quickly find the original plaintext password that corresponds to a stolen password hash.	Weak Hashing Algorithms and lack of Salt (Salt adds a random value to the password before hashing, making rainbow tables ineffective).
